This idea was born of a need to conduct seasonal surveys in a remote region offshore Morro Bay and a desire to minimize the costs associated with our needs. I partnered with NOAA Sanctuaries to conduct a feasibility study in 2022 and we invited colleagues from NOAA Sanctuaries, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Northern Chumash Tribal Council, and the Hispanic Access Foundation for the week-long survey. This amazing collaboration resulted not only in reduced overall costs to conduct our research, the strong connections made during this survey continue to live on through research collaborations. A blog by our partner at NOAA Sanctuaries outlines the positive results from this survey. The following year we conducted three successful seasonal collaborative surveys."
